## Flask Application Design

### HTML Files

- **index.html**: The homepage of the application that will allow users to input their preferences and generate shopping lists.
- **shopping_list.html**: Will display the generated shopping list based on the user's parameters.
- **recipes.html**: Will provide access to recipes, cooking tips, and storage recommendations for items on the shopping list.

### Routes

**1. Home Page (GET /):**

- Displays the **index.html** file, presenting the form for user input.

**2. Generate Shopping List (POST /generate):**

- Captures user input from the form, such as family size, budget, dietary restrictions, etc.
- Processes the input to generate a tailored shopping list.
- Redirects to the **shopping_list.html** page, passing the shopping list data.

**3. Recipe and Information (GET /recipes):**

- Displays the **recipes.html** file, where users can access additional information for items on the shopping list.

## Clarification

- The **generate** route processes user input to create a tailored shopping list, considering factors like family size, budget, and dietary restrictions.
- The **recipes** route provides access to additional information such as recipes, cooking tips, and storage recommendations for items on the shopping list.
